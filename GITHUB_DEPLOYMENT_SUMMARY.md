## üìã Next Steps on GitHub.com

To complete the setup and mark your repository as proprietary on GitHub's interface:

### Step 1: Set Repository to Private (Optional but Recommended)
If you want to restrict who can view your code:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Faaz345/Sora2---Invite-Code-Generator-Website/settings
2. Scroll down to the "Danger Zone" section
3. Click "Change repository visibility"
4. Select "Make private"
5. Confirm the change

**Note**: Private repos are free on GitHub for unlimited collaborators.

### Step 2: Update Repository Settings

1. **Add Repository Description**:
   - Go to the main repo page
   - Click the ‚öôÔ∏è icon next to "About"
   - Add: "Professional Sora 2 invite code generator with payment integration and multi-network ads"
   - Add website: https://getsora2.vercel.app
   - Add topics: `nextjs`, `typescript`, `tailwindcss`, `vercel`, `razorpay`, `ads`, `sora`
   - Check "Releases" if you plan to version
   - Save changes

2. **License Recognition**:
   - GitHub automatically detects the LICENSE file
   - It should show "View license" on the main page
   - The license badge in README will display as "Proprietary"

### Step 3: Branch Protection (Recommended)

Protect your main branch from accidental changes:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Faaz345/Sora2---Invite-Code-Generator-Website/settings/branches
2. Click "Add rule"
3. Branch name pattern: `main`
4. Check:
   - ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
   - ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
5. Click "Create"

### Step 4: Add Repository Topics

Add relevant tags to make your repo more discoverable (if public):

Topics to add:
- `nextjs`
- `typescript`
- `tailwindcss`
- `vercel`
- `razorpay`
- `propellerads`
- `adsterra`
- `admaven`
- `sora`
- `invite-codes`
- `payment-integration`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes

### Sensitive Information to Check:

1. **API Keys and Secrets**:
   - ‚úÖ Make sure Razorpay production keys are NOT in code
   - ‚úÖ Check that ad network IDs are safe to expose (they usually are)
   - ‚úÖ Environment variables should be set on Vercel, not in code

2. **Google Sheet URL**:
   - ‚úÖ Your Google Sheet URL is in the code
   - Make sure it's set to "Anyone with the link can view"
   - Ensure no sensitive data is in the sheet

3. **Files to Keep Private**:
   - If you have `.env.local` or similar files with secrets, ensure they're in `.gitignore`

### Check Your .gitignore

Current .gitignore should include:
```
# dependencies
/node_modules

# production
/build
/.next/
/out/

# environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```
