export const adConfig = {
  googleAdSense: {
    enabled: true,  // ← Change to true

Add inside the `<head>` section:

```typescript
export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <script 
          async 
          src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-1234567890123456"
          crossOrigin="anonymous"
        />
      </head>
      <body className={inter.className}>

    </html>
  )
}
```

### 3.5 Deploy Updated Site

### Approval Timeline:
- **Fast:** 24-48 hours (rare)

### During Review:

     data-ad-slot="9876543210"
     data-ad-format="auto"

<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
```

### 5.2 Add Ad Slot ID to Config

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Ads Not Showing After Approval?

1. **Wait 24-48 hours** - Can take time to activate
2. **Check ad blockers** - Disable to test
3. **Verify code** - Make sure script is loaded
4. **Clear cache** - Browser and site cache
5. **Check console** - Look for JavaScript errors

### How to Check If Working?

**Open Browser Console (F12):**
```javascript
// Check if AdSense loaded
console.log(window.adsbygoogle);
// Should show: Array or Object (not undefined)
```

### Low Earnings?

1. **Traffic source** - Organic > Paid > Social
2. **Geography** - US/UK better than others
3. **Ad placement** - Test different positions
4. **Content** - Better content = Better ads = More $$$

## 📊 Expected Timeline & Earnings

### Timeline:
```
Day 0:   Apply to AdSense
Day 3-7: Approval/Rejection
Day 7:   First ad impressions
Day 30:  First earnings ($10-50)
Day 60:  PIN arrives
Day 90:  Reach $100 threshold
Day 120: First payment received
```

### Earnings Example:
```
100 visits/day   × 30 days = 3,000 visits
3,000 visits     × $2 CPM  = $6/month

1,000 visits/day × 30 days = 30,000 visits
30,000 visits    × $2 CPM  = $60/month

10,000 visits/day× 30 days = 300,000 visits
300,000 visits   × $2 CPM  = $600/month
```

*CPM = Cost Per 1,000 impressions*
