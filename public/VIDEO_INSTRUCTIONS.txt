ðŸŽ¥ HOW TO ADD BACKGROUND VIDEO
================================

1. Place your video file in this folder (public/)

2. Supported file names and formats:
   - background.mp4  (recommended, best compatibility)
   - background.webm (optional, for better compression)

3. Video will:
   âœ“ Auto-play on page load
   âœ“ Loop infinitely
   âœ“ Play muted (required for autoplay)
   âœ“ Cover entire background
   âœ“ Display at 40% opacity

4. Recommended video specs:
   - Resolution: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or higher
   - Format: MP4 (H.264 codec)
   - Frame rate: 30fps or 60fps
   - File size: Keep under 10MB for fast loading
   - Length: 10-30 seconds (since it loops)

5. File path:
   public/
   â””â”€â”€ background.mp4  <-- PUT YOUR VIDEO HERE

6. Full file path example:
   C:\Users\faazr\OneDrive\Desktop\Sora 2 Code generation website\public\background.mp4

7. IMPORTANT NOTES:
   - Video must be muted to autoplay (browser requirement)
   - If video fails to load, starry background will show as fallback
   - Use both .mp4 and .webm for best browser compatibility (optional)

After adding the file, refresh your browser to see the video background!

PRO TIP: For best results, use a dark or subtle video that won't distract
from the main content. The video opacity is set to 40% to maintain readability.
